# Instagram Bot - Complete Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Instagram auto-reply bot from scratch.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Linux/Mac/Windows with Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 installed
- Instagram account credentials
- Basic terminal/command line knowledge

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd /home/adhyan/Desktop/bot-X
```

_Or wherever you've cloned/downloaded this project_

---

### Step 2: Check Python Version

```bash
python3 --version
```

**Required:** Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

- ❌ Python 3.14 is **too new** (dependencies not compatible)
- ✅ Python 3.12 is **recommended**

**If you have Python 3.14 or newer:**

If you're using `mise` (like this project):

```bash
mise install python@3.12
mise use python@3.12
```

Or install Python 3.12 from:

- **Linux**: `sudo apt install python3.12` or your package manager
- **Mac**: `brew install python@3.12`
- **Windows**: Download from python.org

---

### Step 3: Create Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies isolated.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This creates a folder called `venv` in your project directory.

---

### Step 4: Activate Virtual Environment

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**You'll know it's activated when you see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.**

---

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:

- `instagrapi` - Instagram API library
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
- And their dependencies

**Wait for installation to complete** (may take 2-5 minutes)

---

### Step 6: Configure Your Bot

Edit the `.env` file with your details:

```bash
nano .env
```

Or use any text editor. Replace the placeholder values:

```env
YOUR_USERNAME=your_actual_instagram_username
YOUR_PASSWORD=your_actual_instagram_password
TARGET_USERNAME=the_person_you_want_to_monitor
RESPONSE_MESSAGE=Your automatic reply message here
CHECK_INTERVAL=10
```

**Example:**

```env
YOUR_USERNAME=john_doe_123
YOUR_PASSWORD=MySecurePassword123!
TARGET_USERNAME=jane_smith_456
RESPONSE_MESSAGE=Thanks for messaging! I'll reply soon 😊
CHECK_INTERVAL=10
```

**Save and close** (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter` in nano)

---

### Step 7: Run the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

**What happens:**

1. Bot logs into your Instagram account
2. Finds the conversation with your target user
3. Monitors for new messages every 10 seconds (or your configured interval)
4. Auto-replies to every message from that user

---

## 🔐 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

If you have 2FA enabled on Instagram:

1. Run the bot as normal: `python bot.py`
2. Instagram will send you a verification code (SMS/Email)
3. The bot will **prompt you** to enter the code
4. Enter the 6-digit code when asked
5. The bot will save your session for future runs

**Note:** You may also need to approve the login in the Instagram app.

---

## 🛑 Stopping the Bot

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the bot gracefully.

---

## 🔄 Running the Bot Again

After initial setup, you only need:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/adhyan/Desktop/bot-X

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run bot
python bot.py
```

---

## 📁 Project Files Explained

- **`bot.py`** - Main bot script (the code that runs)
- **`.env`** - Your credentials and configuration (KEEP SECRET!)
- **`venv/`** - Virtual environment folder (Python packages)
- **`session.json`** - Login session (created after first run)
- **`requirements.txt`** - List of required Python packages
- **`README.md`** - Project documentation
- **`SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - This file!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security

- **NEVER share your `.env` file** - it contains your password!
- **NEVER share `session.json`** - it's your login session
- **NEVER commit these to Git** - they're in `.gitignore`

### Rate Limits

- **Don't set `CHECK_INTERVAL` too low** (minimum recommended: 10 seconds)
- Instagram may temporarily block you if you send too many requests
- If blocked, increase the interval to 30-60 seconds

### Terms of Service

- Use responsibly
- This is for personal/educational use
- Be aware of Instagram's Terms of Service regarding automation

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'instagrapi'"

- Make sure your virtual environment is activated
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "Login failed"

- Double-check username/password in `.env`
- If you have 2FA, follow the prompts

### "Challenge required"

- Instagram is asking for verification
- Check your phone/email for Instagram code
- You may need to approve login in the Instagram app

### "Connection error"

- Check your internet connection
- Instagram servers might be down (rare)

### Bot not responding to messages

- Make sure you have an existing conversation with the target user
- Check that the target username is correct in `.env`
- Look at the terminal output for errors

### "Python 3.14 not compatible"

- Downgrade to Python 3.12 (see Step 2)
- The dependencies don't support Python 3.14 yet

---

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Changing Response Message

Edit `.env` and change `RESPONSE_MESSAGE`:

```env
RESPONSE_MESSAGE=New message here!
```

### Changing Check Interval

Edit `.env` and change `CHECK_INTERVAL` (in seconds):

```env
CHECK_INTERVAL=30
```

### Monitoring Different User

Edit `.env` and change `TARGET_USERNAME`:

```env
TARGET_USERNAME=new_username
```

**No need to restart the bot** - just kill it (`Ctrl+C`) and run again.
